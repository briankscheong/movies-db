# Movies.DB
Movies.DB is a movie database that has the most up-to-date information about trending movies, including streaming options. This is a Next.js application that connects to a Node backend REST API server. Both the frontend and backend servers are deployed on Vercel.

```
NOTES: 
The movie search functionality in this application only applies to movies in the existing page due to pagination.

Due to the rate limit of 100 daily API calls to the streaming availability service, the application only supports providing streaming availability information for 100 unique movies daily.
