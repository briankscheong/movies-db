# Movies.db
Movies.db is a movie database that has the most up-to-date information about trending movies, including streaming options. This is a Next.js application that connects to a Node backend REST API server.

```
NOTE: If you are testing this app initially, expect the app to take a minute to function as intended. The backend server that hosts the APIs can take up to a minute to spin up due to auto scale down after a period of inactivity.
